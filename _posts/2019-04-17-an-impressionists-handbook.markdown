## Interactable Book Design

## Design Thesis

A new way to engage high school students in art history. This handbook focused on the impressionist period, giving students the ability to be more hands on in their academic studies. This book gives tutorials of drawing techniques by artists which students can practice. They also have access to their own personal art museum, which will give them even more insight into the painting techniques used in the 19th century.

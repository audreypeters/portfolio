## Magazine/Editorial Design

I focused on the hidden arts within towns and cities. Back Alley features amazing graffiti/street artists and locations. The content was taken from spaces I have discovered, including downtown Toronto and New York City. Beginning with the idea and progressing towards a name which had to be subtle and catchy, intriguing the viewer by what’s beyond the cover, I wanted the spreads to be cohesive and yet unique to display each artwork in a way that would match and glorify the street art. Making the aesthetic of the magazine cater to back alleys and hidden area’s of our streets.

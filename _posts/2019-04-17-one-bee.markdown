## Interactable Bag Design

With the diminishing bee population, I was inspired to highlight this problem in an illustrative way. The highlight on the bee symbolizing the one bee and how few there are, the user is interacting with the flower stem, symbolizing how we can help the bees. The bag is made up of compostable materials with vegetable-based inks to not harm the environment. The challenge of the user interacting with the bag, made me think of a more conceptual approach of the user holding the stem of the flower which them wraps around the Savannah Bee Company logo. I used illustration as more elegant approach, also taking the bee from their logo to tie it together nicely.

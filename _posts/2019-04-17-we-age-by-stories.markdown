## Poster Concept

“We age not by years, but by stories”

This illustration displays a timeline concept of adventures/locations that people may encounter throughout their lives. How each stage of their life is simply another story, each molding us into the people we are today. The road ends at a simple home, depicting that this is where we are the happiest and ourselves, everything leading back home. I chose illustration to make it feel more personal and organic.

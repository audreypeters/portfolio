## Typeface \+ Font Release Posters

To create a class collaborative typeface based upon one individualâ€™s preliminary letterform sketches. I created letterforms for a decorative mono-height typeface, inspired by the time period Art Deco. The class decided to move forward with my typeface, establishing all letterforms, numbers and punctuation. Establish spacing and kerning for each letterform for output and functionality.
The posters were to display the typeface in a manner we thought highlighted them well. I stayed with the Art Deco aesthetic.
